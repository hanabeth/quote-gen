# Quote Generator
A small project I did because it's been awhile since I've done vanilla Javascript. Back to the basics.

## About
Ever dreamed of generating random, somewhat inspirational quotes with a click of a button? Well, I've got a treat for you! In the depths of the night I created this minimalist, unoriginal application with wisdom that may or may not be relevant to you. There is also functionality to share the tweet if the spirit so moves you.

Enjoy.
